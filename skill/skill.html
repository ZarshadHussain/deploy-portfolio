                        <li><p>CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is a style sheet language used to define the presentation and layout of HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) documents. It provides a way to control the appearance of web pages by specifying styles for various elements, such as text, colors, fonts, spacing, and positioning. CSS separates the content of a web page from its visual presentation, allowing developers to create consistent and visually appealing designs across multiple web pages or entire websites. CSS works by selecting HTML elements and applying styling rules to them, either inline within HTML, embedded in the HTML document's 'style' tag, or in an external CSS file linked to the HTML document.
